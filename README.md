# Linear Regression: Advanced Modeling Techniques

This repository contains a project aimed at developing a real estate evaluation system using linear regression methodology, which is one of the machine learning techniques. The dataset is a random sample of 5000 properties available for sale in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The data includes the following features: Value (R$), Property Area (m²), Distance from the property to the beach (km) (in a straight line), and Distance from the property to the nearest pharmacy (km) (in a straight line). Due to the skewed distribution of the data, a logarithmic transformation is necessary to achieve satisfactory results with the linear regression method.

## Project Overview
The project aims to explore advanced linear regression modeling techniques to accurately predict real estate values based on the given dataset.
